## Getting Started

### Prereqisites
You must have a RHEL 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, or 7.6 machine with at least 2 GB of memory.(prefereably RHEL 8.x)

To install Red Hat Enterprise Linux on your own machine, go to https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation. You can also create RHEL virtual machines in Azure. See Create and Manage Linux VMs with the Azure CLI, and use --image RHEL in the call to az vm create.

If you have previously installed a CTP or RC release of SQL Server, you must first remove the old repository before following these steps. For more information, see Configure Linux repositories for SQL Server 2017 and 2019.
